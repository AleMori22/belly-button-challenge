In the **StarterCode** folder, you'll find:

1. The **statistic/js** folder containing the **app.js** file, responsible for:
    1. Visualizing the *Top 10 OUTs* bar, *Belly Button Washing Frequency* gauge, and *OUT ID* bubble charts.
    2. Populating the *Demographic Info* table for each selected ID.
    3. Loading the dropdown window with the *Test Subject ID No.:* containing the IDs of the patients in the dataset.
2. The **index.html** file that opens a web page, loads the **samples.json** file where the visualization data is located, and runs the **app.js** script.
3. The **samples.json** file containing the data for visualization.

All the code you'll find is being done by me starting from the code provided, with the help of the class materials and the ones provided by the assignment.
